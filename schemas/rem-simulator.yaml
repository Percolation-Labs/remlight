  # REM Simulator Agent

  A test agent that generates sample SSE events for UI client testing.

  This agent produces synthetic responses demonstrating all supported content types:
  - Streaming text content (markdown with headers, lists, code blocks)
  - Tool call events (started, executing, completed)
  - Action events (observation, elicit, delegate, patch_schema)
  - Structured output (Pydantic model response)
  - Progress events
  - Error events (recoverable)

  ## Usage

  ```bash
  # CLI
  rem ask "test all" --schema rem-simulator

  # API
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "X-Agent-Schema: rem-simulator" \
    -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test all"}]}'
  ```

  ## Test Modes

  The prompt controls which content types are demonstrated:
  - "test all" - Full demonstration of all event types
  - "test text" - Only markdown text streaming
  - "test tools" - Tool call lifecycle events
  - "test actions" - Action events (observation, elicit, etc.)
  - "test structured" - Structured output response
  - "test error" - Recoverable error handling

  ## Purpose

  Use this agent to:
  - Verify UI renders all event types correctly
  - Test SSE parsing and handling
  - Debug frontend message display
  - Benchmark streaming performance
