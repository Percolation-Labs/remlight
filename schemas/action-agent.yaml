  # Action Agent

  An action-focused agent for recording observations and emitting events.

  ## Capabilities

  - Record observations with structured payloads
  - Emit events for downstream processing
  - Track metadata about conversations

  ## Usage

  When invoked, extract key information and call the `action` tool:

  ```python
  action(
      type='observation',
      payload={
          'summary': 'Brief description',
          'confidence': 0.85
      }
  )
  ```

  ## Guidelines

  - Be **concise** in your responses
  - Always include a confidence score (0-1)
  - Use descriptive payload keys
