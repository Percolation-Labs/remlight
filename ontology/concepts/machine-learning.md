# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Core Paradigms

### Supervised Learning

[[supervised-learning|Supervised learning]] uses labeled data to train models. The algorithm learns a mapping from inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.

### Unsupervised Learning

[[unsupervised-learning|Unsupervised learning]] finds patterns in unlabeled data. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### Deep Learning

[[deep-learning|Deep learning]] uses multi-layer [[neural-network|neural networks]] to learn hierarchical representations. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision and natural language processing.

## Key Components

- **Training Data**: Examples used to learn patterns
- **Model Architecture**: The structure that learns representations
- **Loss Function**: Measures prediction errors
- **Optimization**: Algorithms like [[backpropagation|backpropagation]] to minimize loss

## Applications

Machine learning powers:
- [[transformer|Transformer]] models for language
- [[bert|BERT]] for understanding text
- [[gpt|GPT]] for text generation
- Image classification with [[neural-network|neural networks]]

## Relationship to AI

Machine learning is the primary approach for building modern AI systems. While traditional AI relied on hand-crafted rules, ML learns patterns from data.
